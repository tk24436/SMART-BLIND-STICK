# SMART-BLIND-STICK
This code is designed to detect obstacles using ultrasonic sensors and send emergency SMS alerts with GPS coordinates when a button is pressed. It initializes software serial communication for a GPS module (NEO-6M) and a GSM module (a7672s), setting up the necessary pins for ultrasonic sensors, a buzzer, and a button.
In the loop function, it measures distances using ultrasonic sensors and triggers the buzzer with different frequencies if an obstacle is detected within a predefined threshold. The GPS module continuously updates location data, which is displayed on the serial monitor if a valid fix is obtained. If the emergency button is pressed, the system constructs an SMS message with latitude and longitude values and sends it via the GSM module using AT commands.
The getDistance function sends ultrasonic pulses, records the echo return time, and calculates the distance using the speed of sound formula. The sendLocation function verifies GPS validity, formats a text message, and sends it using GSM commands. The system ensures safety and accessibility by providing real-time obstacle detection and emergency location sharing.
